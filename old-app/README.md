## **How to Install**

Follow these steps to set up the E-Commerce API on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js and npm installed
- Docker installed (for running the Dockerized version)

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash

    ```
    
3. Install server dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
4. Create a **`.env`** file in the root directory and add the following:
    
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=
    JWT_SECRET=
    JWT_LIFETIME=
    PORT=
    ```
    
    Replace the placeholders with your actual MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and other necessary environment variables.
    
5. Run the server in development mode:
    
    ```bash
    make dev
    ```
    
6. Access the Swagger API documentation at **`http://localhost:<PORT>/docs`**.
